# Input Mask

## How to Run
1) `$ git clone git@github.com:jpbullalayao/input-mask.git`
2) `$ cd input-mask`
3) `$ npm install`
4) `$ npm start`

## Notes
This implementation handles all the necessary requirements. In order to toggle between as-you-type and pre-masking requirements, go into line 23 and 24 of `MaskedInput.js` and comment one or the other out.

This implementation is a demonstration of some of my basic React/JavaScript/HTML/CSS coding capabilities. I felt there were a lot of places I could have done better (such as, potentially using regexes instead of manually adding characters in the correct spots), however this is always a team effort with whoever I would be working with in the work place. After fulfilling the necessary requirements, I spent some additional time in making a presentable web page for the masked input fields. The HTML/CSS is just a little bit of what I'm capable of; I fully believe I would be able to turn almost any UI mockup into a real web page in a work environment. If time permitted, I would have also written the HTML/CSS to be mobile-friendly.

As far as documentation goes, in addition to the function definitions/parameters that you see in the code's documentation, I would typically write a brief description of what each function does. 

As far as files that I want you to focus looking at, it would be `src/App.js`, `src/App.css`, `src/MaskedInput.js`, and `src/MaskedInput.css`
